## 🗣️ About
This aim of this project is create a program that's simulate a Pipe (|) of the shell.

Let's imagine that I need to send an input from one process to another process. So the output of the process would be an input to the other process

I can do this using a pipe which is represented by this symbol: "|"

My program works to simulating two or more pipes (n pipes)

## ⚙️ Usage
For using this program you will be clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tmatheusdiniz/42-pipex.com
```
Do "make" in the root of the this repository
```sh
make
```
Or "make bonus" to using n pipes. 
```sh
make bonus
```
Run the program
```sh
./bin/pipex infile command_1 command_2 outfile
```
> My program is also capable of simulating a here_doc
>
> To use this tool
```sh
./bin/piex here_doc Limiter command_1 command_2 outfile
```
